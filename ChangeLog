	  Preparations for the 0.4.0 release.
	  
	  This release brings
	  
	  * integration of a new logging module
	  logging can now be configured via the config file or through an
	  environment variable COHERENCE_DEBUG, which overrides the config
	  values.
	  
	  Usage is like
	  COHERENCE_DEBUG=*:3 emit INFO level messages from all modules
	  COHERENCE_DEBUG=*:2,ssdp:4 WARNING level messages from all
	  modules,
	  plus debug level for the ssdp module
	  
	  * removed the dependency for SOAPpy, now using own methods and
	  ElementTree only
	  * start reworking the client API, to make things there easier
	  too,
	  see as an example
	  https://coherence.beebits.net/wiki/CoherenceMediaRenderer
	  * serving cover art now to DLNA MediaRenderers
	  * refinements on the object creation and the import into the
	  MediaServers
	  * an installable package for the Nokia Maemo platform on the
	  N800,
	  complete with all dependecies, thanks to Rob Tylor of
	  http://codethink.co.uk
	  * and a lot more of the usual bugfixes and enhancements

2007-07-24 21:05  dev

	* coherence/upnp/devices/media_renderer.py,
	  coherence/upnp/devices/media_server.py,
	  coherence/upnp/services/servers/media_receiver_registrar_server.py:
	  do not just register services in relation to the devices version
	  number, react appropriate to version 1 only services like the
	  MediaReceiverRegistrar and the ScheduledRecording one - this
	  closes #92

2007-07-24 12:33  dev

	* coherence/upnp/core/DIDLLite.py: added ''originalTrackNumber'' to
	  DIDLLite and be bit more tolerant to attributes with integer
	  values

2007-07-24 08:06  dev

	* coherence/base.py: rearrange log-system initialization - a
	  COHERENCE_DEBUG environment variable has always precedence over
	  the log-level definitions in the config file

2007-07-23 20:28  dev

	* coherence/base.py, coherence/log.py: enable logging and level
	  definition per subsystem via configuration file again

2007-07-23 17:46  dev

	* coherence/base.py, coherence/log.py: enable logging into a file
	  via configuration again

	  failed

2007-07-22 12:45  dev

	* coherence/backends/fs_storage.py, coherence/extern/inotify.py:

2007-07-11 23:42  dev

	* coherence/backends/fs_storage.py, coherence/upnp/core/service.py,
	  coherence/upnp/core/utils.py,
	  coherence/upnp/services/clients/content_directory_client.py:
	  refinements of the CreateObject and ImportResource methods in the
	  FSStore MediaServer, works fine now with our MediaRenderer

2007-07-11 23:39  dev

	* coherence/upnp/core/action.py, coherence/upnp/core/soap_proxy.py:
	  adapt the handling of a single value result to the changes from
	  the move from SOAPpy to our own ElementTree based parser

2007-07-11 23:36  dev

	* coherence/__init__.py, coherence/base.py: one more step in the
	  ''we get the interface detection right'' direction

2007-07-09 21:05  dev

	  some lingering import of twisted.web.soap

2007-07-06 10:33  dev

	  name on OSX, closes #88

2007-07-05 14:41  dev

	* coherence/upnp/devices/media_renderer.py,
	  coherence/upnp/devices/media_server.py: fix the wrong if clause
	  of [548]

2007-07-05 12:57  dev

	* coherence/upnp/devices/media_renderer.py,
	  coherence/upnp/devices/media_server.py: added a keyword argument
	  ''no_thread_needed'' (defaults to False) to initiate backends
	  that are Twisted-friendly or need to run in a non-thread
	  environment

2007-07-04 17:03  philn

	* coherence/extern/inotify.py: call reactor.removeReader when
	  instance release is requested

2007-07-03 20:37  dev

	* coherence/__init__.py, coherence/base.py: some rearrangement of
	  the eggs plugin handling
	  
	  * entrypoints are looked up only if there is at least one plugin
	  to load defined

2007-07-03 19:07  dev

	  adjustment

	  lightyear

2007-07-03 15:03  philn

	  of the coverGetter

2007-07-03 14:53  dev

	* MANIFEST.in, coherence/extern/covers_by_amazon.py,
	  coherence/extern/et.py, coherence/upnp/core/utils.py: * added
	  MANIFEST.in to be prepared for the exclusion of the debion
	  directory
	  * moved parse_xml out of upnp.core.utils.py into
	  coherence.extern.et.py, to remove the dependency from
	  covers_by_amazon.py

2007-07-03 12:05  dev

	  fitting protocolInfo

	  as string for the log system to handle them

2007-06-30 11:05  dev

	* coherence/extern/et.py: we need that specific module import path
	  for the ElementTree module on the Python 2.5 version on the Maemo
	  platform

2007-06-29 17:17  philn

	* coherence/upnp/core/device.py, coherence/upnp/core/ssdp.py: don't
	  attempt to write on None transport

2007-06-27 19:17  philn

	  anymore

2007-06-27 18:43  dev

	  support album art on the container level

2007-06-27 18:11  dev

	* coherence/upnp/core/DIDLLite.py: DLNA attributes for
	  upnp:albumArtURI (testing)

2007-06-27 17:11  dev

	* coherence/upnp/core/DIDLLite.py: disable DLNA decorator due to
	  immanent stupidity

2007-06-27 16:58  dev

	* coherence/extern/et.py, coherence/upnp/core/utils.py: set proper
	  default encoding and handle data that is unicode already

2007-06-27 16:53  dev

	* coherence/upnp/devices/media_server.py: reduce noise

2007-06-27 12:16  dev

	* coherence/extern/et.py, coherence/upnp/core/DIDLLite.py,

	  action to really send out utf-8 data (experimental and untested
	  with Python2.4), re #89

2007-06-26 17:44  dev

	* coherence/upnp/devices/media_renderer_client.py,
	  coherence/upnp/devices/media_server_client.py: follow up to
	  [510], adjusting some debug helper methods

2007-06-26 10:47  dev

	* coherence/upnp/core/DIDLLite.py, coherence/upnp/core/dlna.py: * a
	  beginning of a DLNA decorator module
	  * added xml preamble to the DIDLLite string

2007-06-26 10:45  dev

	  parameter to the StateVariable updated notification

2007-06-26 10:43  dev

	  ContentDirectoryService client Browse action only if requested
	  explicitly

2007-06-25 18:40  dev

	* coherence/extern/inotify.py: some solution to handle unicode
	  pathnames, again this might work only on utf-8 encoded
	  filesystems

2007-06-25 15:06  dev

	* coherence/upnp/services/clients/content_directory_client.py: new
	  version of the UPnP ContentDirectoryService client Browse action,
	  returns a dict with the results of the query as another dict with
	  the key ''items'' included. Might maybe change once more.

2007-06-25 14:51  dev

	* coherence/backends/fs_storage.py,
	  coherence/backends/gstreamer_audio_player.py: * add mp4 files to
	  the list of supported protocolType - closes #87, thx!
	  * store filenames within the FSStore MediaServer as unicode
	  strings - re #63.
	  This will probably still have issues with filesystems that don't
	  use utf-8 encoding.

2007-06-22 15:00  dev

	* coherence/upnp/devices/media_renderer.py,
	  coherence/upnp/devices/media_server.py: get around a missing
	  method in the new logging framework

2007-06-22 14:53  dev

	* coherence/backends/flickr_storage.py: added missing Loggable
	  inheritance

2007-06-22 14:47  philn

	* coherence/upnp/core/service.py: ServiceServer should be a
	  Loggable

2007-06-22 11:58  dev

	* coherence/backends/fs_storage.py,
	  coherence/backends/gstreamer_audio_player.py: some protocolType
	  additions for a simple test of the video handling capabilities of
	  the MediaServer and the MediaRenderer

2007-06-22 08:04  dev

	* coherence/upnp/devices/media_renderer.py: fixed missing import
	  that broke the MediaRenderer

2007-06-22 07:59  dev

	* coherence/extern/covers_by_amazon.py: added usage restrictions
	  (by the Amazon Webservices license) to the doc string

2007-06-20 09:27  philn

	* coherence/base.py, coherence/upnp/core/event.py,

2007-06-20 08:30  dev

	* coherence/upnp/core/soap_lite.py,
	  coherence/upnp/core/soap_service.py: more rework on the creation
	  of an UPnP SOAP error

2007-06-20 08:19  dev

	* coherence/upnp/core/service.py: changed a log level

2007-06-20 08:19  dev

	* coherence/upnp/core/ssdp.py: send bye-bye notifications for
	  "silent" (not-actively) announced devices/services

2007-06-19 20:22  dev

	* coherence/upnp/core/soap_service.py: bug fix for wrong UPnPError
	  creation

2007-06-19 19:26  dev

	  coherence/upnp/core/soap_lite.py,
	  coherence/upnp/core/soap_proxy.py,
	  coherence/upnp/core/soap_service.py: * rewrite of the SOAP
	  classes, now relying solely on the ElementTree api.
	  * this allows us to remove the SOAPpy dependency

2007-06-18 13:40  dev

	* coherence/extern/logger.py: bug fix

2007-06-18 13:33  dev

	* coherence/__init__.py, coherence/base.py,
	  coherence/upnp/core/device.py, coherence/upnp/core/service.py,
	  coherence/upnp/core/utils.py: * add a new device only to the
	  internal list of devices after the detection of its services and
	  its own one has completed successfully, re #82
	  * maybe keep a reference of that unsuccessful attempt and ignore
	  this device after three,... failed attempts?
	  * be more informative about errors during plugin setup
	  * increase svn version number to 0.3.1

2007-06-18 13:22  dev

	* coherence/upnp/devices/media_renderer.py,

2007-06-11 18:08  dev

	* ChangeLog, coherence/__init__.py,
	  coherence/backends/fs_storage.py: preparations for the 0.3.0
	  release

2007-06-10 14:57  dev

	* coherence/upnp/core/ssdp.py,
	  coherence/upnp/devices/media_renderer.py,
	  coherence/upnp/devices/media_server.py: make some local device
	  and service registrations ''silent'', meaning not announcing them
	  via SSDP alive notification messages, but still answer for
	  MSEARCH requests.
	  
	  This should solve an issue causing the PS3 to overbalance when
	  getting notification messages from the same device for different
	  device versions.

2007-06-10 14:52  dev

	* coherence/backends/fs_storage.py,
	  coherence/upnp/core/DIDLLite.py: revert some changes made during

2007-06-10 10:46  dev

	* coherence/upnp/core/service.py,
	  coherence/upnp/devices/media_server.py: fixes some wrong
	  assumption about an int really being one

2007-06-09 15:18  dev

	* coherence/__init__.py, coherence/backends/elisa_storage.py,

	  PS3-test branch changes r456:469 back into trunk.

2007-05-24 19:44  dev

	* coherence/upnp/devices/media_renderer.py,
	  coherence/upnp/devices/media_server.py: enable support for device
	  icons
	  
	  configuration isn't yet optimal - in the section of the
	  MediaServer or MediaRenderer backend in the config file we need
	  something like this:
	  
	  {{{
	  [[[icon]]]
	  mimetype = image/png
	  height = 48
	  width = 48
	  depth = 24
	  url = file:///home/dev/elisa/elisa.png
	  }}}
	  
	  or in the config dict:
	  
	  {{{
	  'icon': { 'url':'http://coherence.beebits.net/image.png',
	  'mimetype': 'image/png',
	  'width':120,
	  'height':120,
	  'depth':24
	  }
	  }}}
	  
	  According to the
	  [http://upnp.org/specs/arch/UPnP-DeviceArchitecture-v1.0-20060720.pdf
	  UPnP Device Architecture p.28] all fields are required. Maybe
	  later Coherence can autogenerate the values with a PIL call.
	  
	  Multiple icons are supported to. The config above has to be
	  wrapped into an '''icons''' section or dictionary, and the
	  '''icon''' has to be replaced with an unique name.

2007-05-21 12:40  dev

	* coherence/backends/elisa_storage.py,
	  coherence/upnp/core/DIDLLite.py: enable the Elisa MediaServer to
	  supply cover images too

2007-05-20 19:03  dev

	* coherence/backends/mediadb_storage.py: use other id3 tag library
	  ([http://pyid3lib.sourceforge.net pyid3lib]) if available, as

	  title in unicode
	  * typo fix

2007-05-19 09:53  dev

	* coherence/backends/mediadb_storage.py: this is a comment addon
	  for [449]
	  
	  * added the image extension to the cover request uri, so clients
	  like the Nokia Media Streamer - which determine the image type by
	  extension and ignore the mimetype - can handle it. This closes
	  #78
	  
	  * reworked the container structure and added an "All tracks of
	  <artist>" at the beginning of the Artist container

2007-05-19 09:43  dev

	* coherence/backends/mediadb_storage.py,
	  coherence/upnp/devices/media_server.py: adapt the recognition of
	  a request for cover art to the new uri with the image extension
	  added, addresses #78

2007-05-19 09:41  dev

	* coherence/upnp/services/servers/content_directory_server.py:
	  remove the wrong conversion of the ObjectID to an integer

	  the MediaStore backend and to support album art/cover retrieval

2007-05-17 19:46  dev

	* coherence/upnp/core/DIDLLite.py: extend MusicTrack with
	  'upnp:albumArtURI' attribute, which could move up to Item anyway

2007-05-17 19:41  dev

	* coherence/extern/covers_by_amazon.py: allow keeping the received
	  image in memory or converting it into a different format with
	  [http://www.pythonware.com/products/pil/index.htm PIL]

2007-05-17 12:18  dev

	  coherence/backends/flickr_storage.py,
	  coherence/backends/fs_storage.py,
	  coherence/upnp/services/servers/content_directory_server.py: use
	  methods to access the MediaServer item attributes, allowing the
	  item to create them on the fly

2007-05-17 12:16  dev

	* setup.py: add the new MediaStore backend to the MediaServer
	  entrypoints

2007-05-17 11:55  dev

	* coherence/extern/logger.py: got it right this time? :-/

	* coherence/extern/logger.py: handle unicode log msg arguments

2007-05-13 20:17  dev

	* coherence/backends/mediadb_storage.py: first version of a
	  MediaStore with a database backend, provides some basic internal
	  functionality, but far from complete

2007-05-13 19:37  dev

	* coherence/extern/covers_by_amazon.py: deal a bit better with the
	  filename extension

2007-05-12 20:30  dev

	* coherence/extern/covers_by_amazon.py: added a callback parameter,
	  so the initiator will get informed when an image retrieval has
	  succeeded

2007-05-12 10:57  dev

	* coherence/extern/covers_by_amazon.py: a small helper module to
	  retrieve covers/album-art via the Amazon ECommerce Webservice
	  with Twisted

	  coherence/upnp/core/device.py, coherence/upnp/core/event.py,
	  coherence/upnp/core/service.py, coherence/upnp/core/ssdp.py: Fix
	  the shutdown method of Coherence, the
	  ''reactor.addSystemEventTrigger( 'before', 'shutdown',
	  self.shutdown)'' expects self.shutdown to return a deferred and
	  waits until that has finished.
	  
	  Now we return a
	  [http://twistedmatrix.com/projects/core/documentation/howto/defer.html#auto7
	  deferredList] in which we collect and wait for all cleanups that
	  have to be done.
	  
	  In addition the way the event unsubscription had to be changed. A
	  new EventProtocol instance seems not to be created by the
	  ClientCreater when the reactor is going down. Which makes some
	  sense anyway. :-)
	  
	  So we keep the protocol instance after our first event
	  subscription request for reuse around and are now able to send
	  out the unsubscribe request.
	  
	  This fixes #75 - at least it is supposed to. If not pls reopen
	  this ticket.

	* coherence/backends/flickr_storage.py: Flickr seems to have
	  changed the way original photos can be retrieved.
	  
	  [http://flickr.com/services/api/misc.urls.html Flickr Photo
	  Source URLs]
	  
	  To access the original photos, we need to construct the url with
	  an ''originalsecret'', which isn't returned in the response to
	  our current request.
	  
	  So for now we just take the default image (medium resolution?)
	  that Flickr offers and try to sort out later what's needed to
	  retrieve that ''originalsecret'' value.
	  
	  This closes #73.

2007-01-09 14:59  dev

	  Adapting the MediaServer to these changes and some cosmetic fixes

	  This also closes #45.

	  Check if a device backend for server service provides all needed
	  action callbacks.
	  
	  If the action is optional, just don't provide it.
	  If it is a required action, don't activate the service.
	  
	  If that service is a required one, this will lead to an abort of
	  the device
	  instantiation.
	  
	  We need an overwrite for this to create in the TestSuite
	  nonconformity devices/services.
	  
	  This closes #25.

2006-12-21 15:59  dev

	* coherence/extern/logger.py: some more logger functionality

2006-12-21 15:56  dev

	* coherence/backends/fs_storage.py: temporally add
	  upnp_GetCurrentConnectionInfo to the backend until we have a
	  solution for #45.

2006-12-20 18:21  dev

	* bin/coherence, coherence/base.py: made the backend passing to the
	  Coherence class a little bit more reasonable/readable - advice by
	  philn

2006-12-20 17:14  dev

	* bin/coherence, coherence/backends/fs_storage.py,
	  coherence/backends/gstreamer_audio_player.py, coherence/base.py,
	  coherence/upnp/devices/media_renderer.py,
	  coherence/upnp/devices/media_server.py: Some first steps in the
	  direction of a plugin system.
	  
	  Let the backends be the only visible things outside of Coherence!
	  
	  We should now be able to add and activate a plugin an startup
	  and, in the next steps, later via the WebUI too, and retrieve
	  from somewhere the configuration for each plugin.
	  
	  And this foundation should be extendable for .egg plugins too.

2006-12-18 22:28  dev

	* bin, bin/coherence, coherence.py, coherence/base.py: Moved
	  Coherence class into the coherence package and the coherence.py
	  into bin/coherence.
	  
	  Added a plugins parameter to Coherence, where a list of classes
	  can be handed over for instantiation.
	  And an add_plugin method to add one later.

2006-12-17 22:34  dev

	* coherence/upnp/core/event.py,
	  coherence/upnp/services/servers/connection_manager_server.py:
	  undo some unnecessary changes

2006-12-17 22:28  dev

	  Everything that was needed to get recognized by the Intel
	  ControlPoint.
	  An audio file will be played and progress displayed on the
	  ControlPoint.
	  Pause, Start and Stop seem to work.
	  
	  There is an issue left on EOS and resetting the
	  CurrentTransportActions.
	  
	  This addresses #38 again.

2006-12-17 19:37  dev

	* coherence/upnp/devices/media_server.py: small fix and more
	  parameters on the call to
	  connection_manager_server.add_connection

2006-12-17 12:43  dev

	* coherence/backends/gstreamer_audio_player.py,
	  coherence/upnp/services/servers/connection_manager_server.py:
	  changes for a better spec compliance, but either we are still
	  missing some things or maybe the Intel ControlPoint expects
	  something out of the usual way?
	  
	  Need to check and compare this with a working MediaRenderer.

2006-12-17 12:40  dev

	* coherence/upnp/core/variable.py: wrong check for last_change
	  attribute, surfaced due to the updates with the new default
	  values in [193]

2006-12-17 12:38  dev

	* coherence/backends/fs_storage.py: proper errback return too

2006-12-17 12:38  dev

	* coherence.py, coherence/upnp/core/service.py,
	  coherence/upnp/core/soap_service.py,
	  coherence/upnp/devices/media_server.py: more work on the logging
	  front re #15.
	  
	  Now we need to enable on/off and a level change via the web-UI.

2006-12-17 12:35  dev

	* coherence/backends/elisa_storage.py: proper errback return

2006-12-17 12:31  dev

	* coherence/extern/inotify.py: more decent class instantiation and
	  a minor typo fix

2006-12-16 22:22  dev

	* coherence.py, coherence/extern/logger.py,
	  coherence/upnp/core/msearch.py, coherence/upnp/core/service.py,
	  coherence/upnp/core/ssdp.py,
	  coherence/upnp/devices/media_renderer.py,
	  coherence/upnp/devices/media_server.py: on the way to some
	  configurable logging function:
	  
	  * enable/disable per module
	  * set log level per module
	  
	  This addresses #15.

2006-12-15 20:05  dev

	  coherence/upnp/core/xml-service-descriptions/ContentDirectory2.xml,
	  coherence/upnp/core/xml-service-descriptions/RenderingControl2.xml:
	  a whole bunch of changes in the xml service descriptions
	  regarding default values and the definition of all allowed
	  values.
	  
	  Plus a our very first '''own''' vendor extension
	  
	  ''coherence:X_withVendorDefines = "True|False"''
	  
	  which defines if a value in
	  
	  * a allowedValueList and
	  * a allowedValueRange
	  
	  can be extended by a vendor.
	  
	  This is currently used only in the description files used for
	  service creation, but it could be inserted into the description
	  files we send out to other devices too.
	  
	  This changeset fixes #37 and #38.

2006-12-13 17:27  dev

	* coherence/backends/fs_storage.py: small self-test change

2006-12-13 10:24  dev

2006-12-13 10:01  dev

	* coherence/upnp/devices/media_server.py: take back [176], as it is
	  probably not needed for the XBox

2006-12-12 13:04  dev

	* coherence/backends/fs_storage.py: first attempt to please an XBox
	  UPnP Search Action for 'all audio items'

2006-12-12 13:00  dev

	* coherence/upnp/core/soap_service.py: let's see the headers of an

2006-12-12 09:59  dev

	* coherence/extern/uuid: more housekeeping

2006-12-12 09:58  dev

	* coherence/upnp/core/xml-service-descriptions: housekeeping

2006-12-12 09:52  dev

	  coherence/extern/uuid/uuid.html, coherence/extern/uuid/uuid.py,
	  coherence/upnp/core/uuid.py,
	  coherence/upnp/devices/media_server.py: generate proper UUIDs,
	  this closes #19 and should help us with devices that are
	  (justifiably) petty about its format.

2006-12-11 22:18  dev

	* coherence/upnp/devices/media_server.py: and again...

2006-12-11 21:48  dev

	* coherence/upnp/devices/media_server.py: one more

2006-12-11 21:33  dev

2006-12-11 20:41  dev

	* coherence/upnp/devices/media_server.py: one more change to find
	  out the XBox' likings

2006-12-11 20:18  dev

	* coherence/upnp/devices/media_server.py: some more adjustments to
	  get recognized by the XBox, added DLNA tags

2006-12-11 18:45  dev

	* coherence/upnp/devices/media_server.py: fake a Windows Media
	  Connect server to get discovered by an XBox MediaRenderer

2006-12-11 18:07  idnar

	* coherence/upnp/core/device.py, coherence/upnp/core/service.py,
	  coherence/upnp/core/soap_proxy.py: Pass correct args to

2006-12-11 17:51  dev

	* coherence/upnp/core/msearch.py, coherence/upnp/core/ssdp.py,

	  is really time for proper logging :-(

2006-12-11 09:29  dev

2006-12-10 20:43  dev

	* coherence.py, coherence/upnp/core/msearch.py,

	  Quite some other adjustments and fixes related to StateVariable

2006-12-02 16:41  dev

	* coherence/extern/inotify.py: a simple Python
	  [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inotify Inotify] interface, using
	  [http://python.net/crew/theller/ctypes/ ctypes] for the kernel
	  calls, works only on Linux with a kernel > 2.6.13 and

2006-11-27 15:16  dev

	* python-upnp/elisa_storage.py: item.res.size is an optional
	  attribute -as the Elisa MediaStore isn't (yet) providing it, it
	  should be set to None if not present in the response from the
	  MediaStore.

2006-11-26 18:01  dev

	* python-upnp/elisa_storage.py, python-upnp/media_server.py: dumb

2006-11-26 16:19  dev

	* python-upnp/service.py: fix soap_generic in such a way, that the

	  enhancements regarding a working MediaServer.
	  
	  Some of them concerning the different namespace, which refs to
	  #28.
	  
	  Fixed an embarrassingly stupid bug in the device registration,
	  where we had the services url in the location header of the
	  service notification, instead of the url for the device
	  description.xml, this is one of those that fixes #26.
	  
	  This only showed up due to the fact that the Noxon-2 looks only
	  for service notifications.
	  
	  Version 2 devices now send out notifications for devices v1 and
	  services v1 too. Requisite for this are different device
	  descriptions accordingly to the version, pointing to the matching
	  services.

2006-11-21 13:06  dev

	* python-upnp/media_receiver_registrar_server.py,
	  python-upnp/xml-service-descriptions/X_MS_MediaReceiverRegistrar1.xml:
	  This adds a MediaReceiverRegistrar with a FakeBackend, that just
	  affirms any IsAuthorized and IsValidated actions.

2006-11-19 16:41  dev

	* python-upnp/coherence.py, python-upnp/fs_storage.py,
	  python-upnp/media_server.py: removed 'uuid:' part from the

	  First 'usable' approach to couple the action callbacks with the
	  methods the backend provides.
	  
	  We still need 'some' knowledge about UPnP in the backend, maybe
	  this can be reduced further.

2006-11-17 11:30  dev

	* python-upnp/content_directory_server.py,

	  with the elisa UPnP plugin

2006-11-17 11:14  dev

2006-11-04 13:49  dev

	* python-upnp/connection_manager_server.py,
	  python-upnp/content_directory_server.py, python-upnp/service.py:

2006-11-04 12:29  dev

	* python-upnp/connection_manager_server.py,

2006-11-01 16:13  dev

	* python-upnp/connection_manager_server.py,
	  python-upnp/content_directory_server.py, python-upnp/service.py:
	  refactored server service into a more universal service.Server
	  class for mix-in.
	  
	  Added EventSubscriptionServer from #11.

2006-11-01 15:53  dev

	* python-upnp/event.py: server side event subscription and
	  notification, re #11
	  
	  The loop for sending out moderated events is not yet there ->
	  check [48].

2006-10-26 15:34  dev

	* python-upnp/uuid.py: Adjusted copyright just to be sure

2006-10-26 15:30  dev

	* python-upnp/media_server.py, python-upnp/uuid.py: Moved
	  generateuuid into its own UUID class so we can use it for SIDs
	  too.
	  Not sure if the str(instance) approach via __repr__ is sacrosanct
	  or if a self.uuid.get_uuid() construct is a better way to handle
	  this.

2006-10-23 11:14  dev

	* python-upnp/coherence.py,
	  python-upnp/connection_manager_server.py,
	  python-upnp/media_server.py: accommodations to
	  ArchitecturalOverview

2006-10-23 11:11  dev

	* python-upnp/ssdp.py: fixed old, mooching little bug, spotted by
	  philn

2006-10-15 20:55  dev

	* python-upnp/connection_manager_server.py: experimenting with a
	  generic soap method to save us from too many similar function
	  definitions.
	  
	  Maybe we can use this technique in the XMLRCP api too.

2006-10-15 20:51  dev

	* python-upnp/soap_service.py: extend UPnPPublisher so we can use a
	  generic soap method for the trivial actions in a server service.

2006-10-15 20:47  dev

	* python-upnp/content_directory_server.py: Copied over soap methods
	  from PyMedS.

2006-10-15 20:45  dev

	* python-upnp/action.py: Extend action class with a callback so it
	  is more useful in a server service.

2006-10-14 14:59  dev

	* python-upnp/media_server.py: Proper registration of ourself to
	  the SSDP server and corrected services url creation.

2006-10-14 14:56  dev

	* python-upnp/connection_manager_server.py,
	  python-upnp/content_directory_server.py: Fix serviceStateTable
	  typo in scpd.xml creation, added instantiation of
	  EventSubscriptionServer and use v2 of the service description
	  file.

2006-10-14 14:48  dev

	* python-upnp/media_server_client.py: Temporarily remove testing of
	  Browse action to handle our own half-done ContentDirectory
	  service.

2006-10-14 14:46  dev

	* python-upnp/content_directory_client.py: Adjust licence, address
	  #7

2006-10-14 14:44  dev

	* python-upnp/control_point.py, python-upnp/event.py: Added
	  EventSubscriptionServer and initiated it in
	  connection_manager_server.py and content_directory_server.py.
	  
	  Functionality is still missing!!!
	  
	  Removed an obsolete argument from EventServer `__init__`.
	  
	  Addresses #11.

2006-10-14 14:39  dev

	* python-upnp/ssdp.py: Reworked the SSDP server implementation.
	  
	  The dict items, that represent discovered remote or registered
	  local devices have now a manifestation attribute to distinguish
	  between local or remote devices.
	  
	  We do now resend notifications every 770 seconds.
	  These resends seem to be 'best practice' in case some
	  ControlPoint had missed the discovery responses.
	  
	  Talking of these, discovery responses are now implemented too.
	  
	  Notifications and discovery responses are only send out for local
	  devices.

2006-10-14 14:31  dev

	* python-upnp/service.py: commented out noisy print

2006-10-14 14:30  dev

	* python-upnp/coherence.py: commented out noisy print

2006-10-14 14:24  dev

	* python-upnp/msearch.py: Adjust loop time for msearch, now do
	  searches every 120 seconds.
	  Maybe that's still too often.
	  
	  Add the manifestation argument to the SSDP.register call and
	  modified the licence.

2006-10-14 14:17  dev

	* python-upnp/xml-service-descriptions/AVTransport2.xml,
	  python-upnp/xml-service-descriptions/ConnectionManager2.xml,
	  python-upnp/xml-service-descriptions/ContentDirectory2.xml,
	  python-upnp/xml-service-descriptions/MediaRenderer2.xml,
	  python-upnp/xml-service-descriptions/MediaServer2.xml,
	  python-upnp/xml-service-descriptions/RenderingControl2.xml,
	  python-upnp/xml-service-descriptions/ScheduledRecording1.xml:
	  Actually it is a good idea to use the correct xml files if you
	  want to support MediaServer V2 and MediaRenderer V2 ;-)
	  
	  This is an supplement to [25] and addresses #10 again.

2006-10-13 09:56  dev

	* python-upnp/variable.py: adjust faulty argument order in
	  StateVariable init

2006-10-12 14:48  dev

	* python-upnp/connection_manager_server.py,
	  python-upnp/content_directory_server.py,
	  python-upnp/media_server.py: Add and integrate
	  content_directory_server.py on the way to a working basic
	  MediaServer.
	  
	  Some of the changes in media_server.py in the device xml
	  description generation close #10.

2006-10-12 13:35  dev

	* python-upnp/action.py, python-upnp/coherence.py,
	  python-upnp/connection_manager_server.py,
	  python-upnp/media_server.py, python-upnp/service.py,
	  python-upnp/soap_service.py, python-upnp/variable.py,
	  python-upnp/xml-service-descriptions,
	  python-upnp/xml-service-descriptions/AVTransport1.xml,
	  python-upnp/xml-service-descriptions/ConnectionManager1.xml,
	  python-upnp/xml-service-descriptions/ContentDirectory1.xml,
	  python-upnp/xml-service-descriptions/RenderingControl1.xml:
	  Reverted the way the WebInterface is handled and add some simple
	  page-generation to allow easier browsing of the children.
	  
	  Included the xml-services-descriptions directory and use the xml
	  files therein as the source for the server services definition.
	  
	  This addresses #10.
	  
	  And finally added connection_manager_server.py and
	  soap_service.py for an initial test of a server service.

2006-10-11 16:50  dev

	* python-upnp/coherence.py, python-upnp/control_point.py,
	  python-upnp/device.py, python-upnp/media_server.py,
	  python-upnp/service.py, python-upnp/ssdp.py,
	  python-upnp/utils.py: Another big one which removes the blocking
	  urllib2.urlopen call
	  and adds signal based propagation of events, e.g. SSDP
	  new_device,
	  to get around too much deferred wizardry in the device,sub-device
	  and service detection.
	  
	  This introduces [http://pylouie.org louie] as signal dispatcher.

2006-10-09 09:52  dev

	* python-upnp/coherence.py, python-upnp/control_point.py,
	  python-upnp/event.py, python-upnp/rpc_client.py,
	  python-upnp/ssdp.py: This is a big changeset that turns upside
	  down a lot of
	  how the parts within the UPnP framework are dealt with.
	  
	  There is now an embracement class called Coherence that
	  deals with all the parts needed to run an UPnP service.
	  And allows in the future a more plugin based structure.
	  
	  There we decide whether we only want to be a ControlPoint,
	  only a MediaRenderer, only a MediaServer or any combination
	  of these.
	  
	  The SSDP and the MSEARCH subsystems have now their home there.
	  
	  And only one webserver instance is created where all the other
	  subsystems can register their services as childs.
	  
	  For example the ControlPoint appends there its Event Notification
	  service and its XMLRPC interface.
	  And of course it can append there its own web-interface.
	  
	  Likewise for the MediaServer. It appends its XML files,
	  the Event Subscription service, the SOAP interface and its
	  media files.
	  
	  Hopefully not to many things broke with this changeset,
	  actually and intendedly we should be on the same functionality
	  level like before.

2006-10-09 09:29  dev

	* python-upnp/media_server.py, python-upnp/root-device.xml: some
